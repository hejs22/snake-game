# Snake2D

Started this project to sum up my Java knowledge (2 days before first commit I hadn't even known how Java looks like). 

Control your snake with direction arrows. Press 'R' to restart.
- Red square - apple, your snake grows, game speeds up a bit.
- Cyan square - freeze, your snake stops, game slows down a little bit more.
- Yellows square - shrink, your snake is now shorter by half.
- Pink square - watermelon, your snake grows x5.
