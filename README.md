# Snake2D

As simple as it can be. Started this project to sum up my Java knowledge (2 days before first commit I hadn't even known how Java looks like). 
Control your snake with direction arrows. Every time you eat an apple, game speeds up a little bit, up to specific value.

In future I will add restart button, score and powerups system (maybe). Also, code needs to be cleaned up.
